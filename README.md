# ios-quotes-app

iOS App which uses the Goodreads API to load random quotes and display them for the user.

Currently allows users to
- Load and view random quotes
- Add filters to the quotes to restrict them to specific tags/books/authors
- Share an image of these quotes to social media (and wherever else)
- Login to Goodreads and add the books the quote they are viewing is from to one of their shelves
- Use 3D Touch to select a shelf directly from the main screen

Roadmap
- Some bugfixing
- The ability to add a new shelf to your Goodreads
- Make those ugly settings screens look nicer
